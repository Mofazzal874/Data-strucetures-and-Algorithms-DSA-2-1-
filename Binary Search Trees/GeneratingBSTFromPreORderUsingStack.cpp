//From the property of Binary Tree , we know that , if inOrder +preOrder or inOrder + preOrder is given , then we can generate 
// tree from traversals.

//But in the case of Binary Search Tree , InOrder Traversals always gives sorted ascending elements.
//So we don't need InOrder traversals.We only need preOrder or postOrder traversal given.
